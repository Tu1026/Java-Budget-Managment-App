# Budget Tracker

### Achieve financial independence with just the tips of you fingers!

Cool features that it provides:
- Keep track of you goals (cars, traveling, etc).
- Daily reports and month reports of financial progress.
- Categorize purchases to help eliminate unnecessary spendings.
- Take your salary into account.
- Also helps you manages your mortgages/debts

This application helps people make smarter financial decision by categorizing all the spending into different categories 
so it’s easy for them to visualize where they can save money on. With the included goal tracker feature people are also 
more motivated so save up towards their financial goals. This application can be used by essentially anyone who has the 
desired to learn more about their spending habits and saving habits.

This project is interesting to me because the existing budget trackers place heavy focus on just the **spending part** 
of finance and completely neglected the **saving part**. To me an application that can take all aspects of our 
financial life into account including mortgages, cars, stock, and more is exciting. With every wider use of **apple pay/
google pay** this application can eventually be designed to take data from those paying methods so people don’t have to
manually enter their spending.
